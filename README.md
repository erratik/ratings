tv ratings web scraper
================

Simple web scraper to get information from http://www.mediaite.com/'s rating pages

Just putting a page number to start from going through the pages to find all the links to ratings pages and writing them to JSON file with a {'UTCDATE': 'URL'} format.

Once I have all the pages I want, I can use that object to start scraping the data in the ratings table on each page! 

You're welcome, Brian <3
